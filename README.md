# Home_Sales

Module 22 Challenge on Big Data

In this challenge, I used SparkSQL to analyze home sales data to find the following:
1. the average price for a 4-bedroom house by year, 
2. the average price for 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms home by year, 
3. the average price of a home with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 2 floors, and is >= 2,000 square feet by year
4. the "view" rating for homes costing >= $350,000
